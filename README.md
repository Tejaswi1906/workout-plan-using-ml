Introduction
In today’s fast-paced digital world, staying fit and healthy is a top priority for many. However, not everyone has access to personal trainers or customized plans that suit their individual needs. This is where Machine Learning (ML) steps in — using data to design intelligent, adaptive, and personalized workout plans.

Objective
The main aim of this project is to:

Develop a system that recommends customized workout routines.

Tailor plans based on user goals, body type, fitness level, medical history, and daily habits.

Continuously adapt and improve the plan based on user progress and feedback.

Dataset
We use datasets that typically contain:

User information: Age, gender, height, weight, BMI

Fitness goals: Weight loss, muscle gain, endurance

Activity history: Steps, workouts, sleep patterns, calories burned

Health conditions: Injuries, medical restrictions (if any)

Public datasets or wearable device data (like from Fitbit or Apple Health) can also be used.

Methodology
Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values, outliers

Feature engineering (e.g., BMI calculation, activity trends)

User Segmentation

Using clustering algorithms like K-Means or Hierarchical Clustering to group users by fitness levels or goals.

Model Building

Recommendation Models: Collaborative Filtering or Content-Based Filtering for workout suggestions.

Predictive Models: Regression or Classification algorithms to predict calories burned or goal achievement probability.

Workout Plan Generator

Based on user cluster and prediction output, the system recommends exercises (e.g., cardio, strength, flexibility).

Uses rules and ML outputs to structure weekly/daily plans.
